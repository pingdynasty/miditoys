    <h1 id="usage">Usage Instructions</h1>

    <h2>General controls</h2>
    <p>All controls have tool tips, by hovering over or focusing (using the tab button) a control you can see what function it has. Some controls have no function, but are part of the BCR2000 interface - these will have a tooltip that says 'not in use'.</p>

    <p>The start/stop button is the same as the BCR2000 'store' button, it is the third button down in the second to last column of buttons. It will light up if you choose 'start' from the menu. When the oscillator is started, you can see any changes made in the oscillator settings in the waveform window at the top of the screen. You should also be able to hear a soft hum generated by the waveform.</p>

    <h2>Oscillator controls</h2>
    <p>The amplitude of the oscillator's first eight states can be controlled with the top row of push encoders (knobs). Any given combination of amplitudes will produce a different waveform, and hence a different sound.</p>
    <p>Below the knobs there is a row of eight buttons. These let you select so called single states, which will turn all amplitudes but the selected one to zero.</p>
    <p>The bottom row of knobs control certain other aspects of the oscillator which you can experiment with. These are, from left to right:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Glauber State (Average Energy)</li>
      <li>Wavelength</li>
      <li>Distance</li>
      <li>Time Step</li>
      <li>Scale Factor (Overall Amplitude)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Setting the Glauber state forces the state amplitudes into a coherent state (after R.J. Glauber, Nobel Prize 2005). The Wavelength control will determine how wide the overall wavelength is. Distance lets you move the wavelength to the left or right within the sample window. The Scale Factor controls the overall amplitude, turning it up will increase the volume of the sound but might lead to clipping.</p>
    <p>The application allows you to switch between four different oscillators, using the four buttons in the top right corner. This allows you to prepare up to four different sets of oscillator settings and switch without stopping and restarting.<p>

    <h2>Audio controls</h2>
    <p>The row of knobs that is is above the bottom row is dedicated to audio controls. The number and nature of controls depends on the capabilities of you Java Sound setup, which in turn depends on what version of Java you use. Typically you will here have the following controls (from left to right):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Master Gain (or Volume)</li>
      <li>Pan (or Balance)</li>
      <li>Sample Rate</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These controls affect various aspects of the audio output. Sample Rate will also impact the waveform speed, since the audio output frequency determines the oscillator update rate.</p>
