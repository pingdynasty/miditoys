    <p><i>bcr harms</i> is a model of the quantum harmonic oscillator turned into a soft synth. Single states can be triggered through buttons or MIDI input. Its knobs let you set the relative amplitude of the first 8 states of the harmonic oscillator and a number of control parameters. The program's interface was modelled on the Behringer BCR2000, and can (with great advantage) be used with a MIDI controller.</p>
