    <h1 id="configuration">MIDI Configuration</h1>
    <p>The MIDI configuration is accessed by choosing <i>setup</i> in the bcr harms menu. If you select <i>send Sysex MIDI messages</i> then your MIDI controller will receive SysEx configuration message - you should probably only use this with a Behringer BCR2000.</p>
    <h2>MIDI Input and Output</h2>
    <p><i>bcr harms</i> responds to MIDI input. Sending notes to bcr harms will trigger single state settings - the first single state corresponds to middle C (MIDI note 60) and the other single states are in half-note steps up from there. You can also send MIDI start and stop messages, to start/stop the oscillator.</p>
    <h3>Controller Configuration</h3>
    <p><i>bcr harms</i> was designed to complement the Behringer BCR2000 controller. It can be used on its own, but you will have much more fun with a few real knobs to tweak.</p>
    <p>If you have a BCR2000, make sure it is attached and switched on when you start the application. Then go to the MIDI configuration, and set the BCR2000 MIDI input and output buses under <i>Control input</i> and <i>Control output</i>.</p>
    <p>When closing the configuration window, the application will send Sysex messages to setup your BCR2000. If for some reason you don't like the configuration, you can use the preset buttons on the device to change it. The application setup is based on factory preset 1, but adds functionality for several keys.</p>
    <p>Almost any MIDI controller capable of sending CC (<i>CONTROL CHANGE</i>) messages can be configured to work with bcr harms, by following similar control assignments.</p>

    <h2>Audio Settings</h2>
    <p>Under <i>Miscellaneous</i> you can control various settings which affect the oscillator and audio output quality. If you are hearing pops or crackles in the audio output, you may have to decrease the oscillator sample width or audio output frequency, or increase the audio buffer size. Typically for good performance the audio buffer should be four times the size of the oscillator sample width, though you may have to experiment to find the best configuration for your platform.</p>
    <p>If you are experiencing a lag between the waveform display and the audio, you might have too large an audio buffer. See if you can decrease the audio buffer size without loss of audio quality.</p>

    <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
    <p>If your are on Mac OS X and the MIDI devices don't show up in the configuration list, then you will need to download and install a working MIDI SPI such as the <a href="http://www.mandolane.co.uk/dlPlumstone.html">Plumstone SPI</a>.</p>
