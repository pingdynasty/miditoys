<!--     <h1>bcr steps</h1> -->
    <p><i>bcr steps</i> is a pretty sweet eight-step sequencer and arpeggiator, with features that control velocity, duration, delay, modulation and bend for each step. It handles MIDI input and output and can (with great advantage) be used with a MIDI controller.</p>
