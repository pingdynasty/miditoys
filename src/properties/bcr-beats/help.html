<!--     <h1>bcr beats</h1> -->
    <p><i>bcr beats</i> is a beatslicer that lets you cut audio samples into slices. The slices can be played back and looped, or triggered through MIDI input. For each slice you can control the start and end positions within the sample, the playback volume, stereo pan and sample rate (speed). The program's interface was modelled on the Behringer BCR2000, and can (with great advantage) be used with a MIDI controller.</p>
